deebs
=====

Deebs is a simple JavaScript database library designed for browser based apps.

Deebs simplifies many common data operations, freeing you up to focus on the less mundane coding task.

Deebs can:
*Fetch unique records
*Remove duplicates records (dedupe)
*Search for similar records
*Search records by properties
*Retrieve  muliple records by range or collection

Deebs is extensible and plays well with others (jQuery, Dojo, SmartClient RIA and others).
14kb (minified) makes this a very lean little library.
